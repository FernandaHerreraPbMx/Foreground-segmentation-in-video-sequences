# Foreground-segmentation-in-video-sequences

Basic foreground segmentation was implemented using a simple background model, background update and stationary object supression. Advanced foreground methods include using single gaussian and gaussian mixture models to define the background model and background update. A module for shadow supression according to image chromacity was also implemented. These methods were evaluated using the “VideoSlidesAVSA” dataset and the Baseline, Shadow and Dynamic Background categories from the “changedetection” dataset [4].
