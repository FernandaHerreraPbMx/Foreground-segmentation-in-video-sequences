# Foreground-segmentation-in-video-sequences

Basic foreground segmentation was implemented using a simple background model, background update and stationary object supression. Advanced foreground methods include using single gaussian and gaussian mixture models to define the background model and background update. A module for shadow supression according to image chromacity was also implemented. These methods were evaluated using the “VideoSlidesAVSA” dataset and the Baseline, Shadow and Dynamic Background categories from the “changedetection” dataset [4].
